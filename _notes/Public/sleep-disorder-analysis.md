Stress has become a critical public health concern, yet its relationship with daily habits remains complex to quantify. In this project, we explore how an individual’s sleep wellness relates to their reported stress level using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. Our goal is to investigate whether sleep patterns can help explain or predict how stressed a person feels. To do this, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand trends in the data and build a predictive model to evaluate how well sleep duration and related lifestyle variables can estimate a person’s stress level. Our analysis reveals a significant inverse relationship between sleep metrics and stress. Specifically, our model achieved an $$R^2$$ score of $$0.51$$, corroborating that shorter sleep duration and lower quality are associated with higher self-reported stress. However, residual analysis suggests non-linear relationships that a linear model may not fully capture. These findings highlight the potential of using simple lifestyle metrics for stress assessment, while also indicating the need for more complex modeling techniques to account for the nuanced nature of sleep health.
