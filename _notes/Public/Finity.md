*User Story*: As a student, I currently track my expenses and budget in a spreadsheet with entries like date, price, and description. I want to better understand my spending habits and financial situation.

Finity's ideas simplify personal finance management by letting users upload their expense spreadsheets with categories. The ultimate goals are to help users easily track their monthly spending and make informed budgeting decisions. The cloud-based application provides the following features:

- **Summaries**: Overviews of monthly spending and savings for each category.
- **Predictions**: Forecasts of future spending for each category
- **Visualizations**: Charts of historical spending trends for each category.

This is a collaborative project in which my work includes 1) developing the sending prediction algorithm; 2) configuring AWS cloud services; and 3) formatting and finalizing the project presentation.
