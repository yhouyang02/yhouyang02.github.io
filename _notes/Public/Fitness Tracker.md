Traditional gyms often lack online platforms for customers to access their training programs. This can be problematic for individuals looking to plan professional fitness routines. This project aims to design an application to bridge this gap. Our solution offers:

- An online platform for gyms to showcase their programs.
- A comprehensive service for users to track health metrics, manage subscriptions, state preferences, and find the best-suited fitness plan.

This is a collaborative project in which my major work include 1) querying fitness data from the database; and 2) routing the queried results to the frond-end.
