#### Application Support Analyst @ [BCCNM](https://www.bccnm.ca/) (Present)

I am part of an Agile team that provides Level 3 application support. As a system analyst, I validate system changes, bug fixes, and feature updates. I configure CRM systems, including automated workflows, system views, and product rules. I perform regression tests and automated web tasks using JavaScript and Nightwatch.js framework. I also help with Level 2 product support during busy months, directly handling registrants' immediate concerns such as nursing class changes, refunds, and issues related to their nursing application process.

<u>Technologies</u>: Dynamics 365 • JavaScript • Jenkins • Selenium • Team Foundation Server • Visual Studio
