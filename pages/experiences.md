<!-- #### Undergraduate Teaching Assistant • PT @ [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) (Sep 2023 - present) -->

#### Application Developer • Co-op @ [ICBC](https://www.icbc.com/) (May 2023 - Aug 2023)
I was a member of the SDLC Improvement team which ensured stable delivery of multiple applications. I helped develop a prototype of internal web applications using the OutSystem platform. I also explored the integration of automation testing and designed a full automation test suite for a client-oriented application using Java and Selenium, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of our testing processes.

<u>Technologies</u>: Eclipse • Java • JUnit • Maven • OutSystems • Selenium • TestNG

#### Application Support Analyst • Co-op @ [BCCNM](https://www.bccnm.ca/) (Sep 2022 - Apr 2023)
I was part of a Scrum team that provided Level 3 application support. As a system analyst, I validated system changes, bug fixes, and feature updates. I configured CRM systems, including automated workflows, system views, and product rules. I performed regression tests and automated web tasks using JavaScript and the Nightwatch.js framework. I also helped with Level 2 product support during busy months, directly handling registrants' immediate concerns such as nursing class changes, refunds, and issues related to their nursing application process.
