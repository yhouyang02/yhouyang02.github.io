\
I am Yuheng Ouyang, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. My interests range from software engineering, health psychology, pour-over coffee, spicy hot pots...

I am a current Undergraduate Teaching Assistant of [*CPSC 110: Systematic Program Design*](https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/syllabus.html) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). I previously worked as Application Developer at [ICBC](https://www.icbc.com/) and Application Support Analyst at [BC College of Nurses and Midwives](https://www.bccnm.ca/). I am actively seeking full-time/new-grad job opportunities from June 2025 onwards.
