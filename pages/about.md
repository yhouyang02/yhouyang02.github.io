\
I am Yuheng Ouyang, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. My interests range from software engineering, health psychology, pour-over coffee, spicy hot pots...

I am a current Co-op at [BC College of Nurses and Midwives](https://www.bccnm.ca/). I am actively seeking Intern/Co-op opportunities in Summer 2023.
