I am Yuheng Ouyang, a Master of Data Science student at the University of British Columbia. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UBC in 2025.

I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. My interests range from aviation, psychology, pour-over coffee, hot pots...

While being a student, I worked as Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for [*CPSC 110/107: Systematic Program Design*](https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/syllabus.html) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), Application Developer at [Insurance Corporation of British Columbia](https://www.icbc.com/) and Application Support Analyst at [BC College of Nurses and Midwives](https://www.bccnm.ca/). I am preparing for full-time job opportunities in 2026.
