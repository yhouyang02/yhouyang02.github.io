\
I am Yuheng Ouyang, an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia. I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. My interests range from software engineering, health psychology, pour-over coffee, spicy hot pots...

I am a current Application Develpoment Co-op at [ICBC](https://www.icbc.com/). I previously worked as Applicaion Support Analyst at [BC College of Nurses and Midwives](https://www.bccnm.ca/). I am casually browsing part-time oppotunities starting September 2023.
